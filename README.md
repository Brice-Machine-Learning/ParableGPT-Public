# 📚 ParableGPT

> Semantic Search and Exploration Platform for Religious Texts

---

## ✨ Overview

**ParableGPT** is a modern AI-powered platform designed to help users explore religious texts in entirely new ways. 

Traditional keyword searches often miss the deeper connections and thematic relationships found in sacred writings. ParableGPT solves this by leveraging state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to enable:

✅ **Semantic search** — find verses with similar meaning, not just exact words  
✅ **Cross-text exploration** — discover thematic links across multiple religious texts  
✅ **Topic modeling** — visualize major themes and topics  
✅ **Summarization** — distill lengthy passages into concise, readable summaries  
✅ **Personalization** — save favorites and track searches (premium)

This project demonstrates end-to-end ML engineering — from data pipelines to ML model deployment and full-stack integration.

## 🎯 Business Problem

Religious texts are vast, multi-layered, and often complex. Scholars, faith leaders, educators, and curious readers need tools to:

- Search meaningfully beyond keywords  
- Compare passages across traditions  
- Summarize dense content for better understanding

ParableGPT aims to provide **an AI assistant for religious text exploration**, making spiritual study, research, and teaching more efficient and insightful.
